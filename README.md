# Banking Application (Assignment)

## Notes

-   Make sure to update the server address in `src/services/Api.js` if you happen to run the server at a different host or port

-   The Banker is allowed to sign up only to make it easy to create an account. A banker shouldn't be allowed to create an account publicly.
